We are using Table Driven real time scheduling algorithm
Enter the number of Process you want to Execute
Number of process in execution are : 3
Name of process is : 1
Burst time of process is : 1
Period of process is : 4
Name of process is : 2
Burst time of process is : 2
Period of process is : 5
Name of process is : 3
Burst time of process is : 1
Period of process is : 20
Process 1executes from 0to 1
Process 2executes from 1to 3
Process 3executes from 3to 4
Process 1executes from 4to 5
Process 2executes from 5to 7
No Process executes from 7to 8
Process 1executes from 8to 9
No Process executes from 9to 10
Process 2executes from 10to 12
Process 1executes from 12to 13
No Process executes from 13to 14
No Process executes from 14to 15
Process 2executes from 15to 17
Process 1executes from 17to 18
No Process executes from 18to 19
No Process executes from 19to 20
